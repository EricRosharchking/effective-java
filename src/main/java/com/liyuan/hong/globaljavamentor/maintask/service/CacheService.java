    /*Implement cache service. Cache entries (objects) â€“ simple custom class with one String field. Your cache service should have 2 methods: get and put.

    Your cache service should fit next requirements:

    Max Size = 100000;
    Eviction policy;
    Time-based on last access (5 seconds);
    Removal listener;
    Just add to log of removed item;
    Give statistic to user;
    Average time spent for putting new values into the cache;
    Number of cache evictions;
    Support concurrency.
    This task should be implemented in two ways:

    Simple Java (2 points) (Strategy: LFU);
    Guava (1 point) (Strategy: LRU).
    Don't forget about good tests, checkstyle and other staff that already included into your build phase.
